            <p>&emsp;In this section, we've tried to answer any possible questions about the video conversion service.</p>
            <h3 id="question_1">Is there a limit on the number of files I can convert?</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Our video conversion service is completely free and there is no limit to the number of files you can convert. You can use our website as much as you like.</p><br>
            <h3 id="question_2">How long does it work to convert a video?</h3>
            <p>&emsp;While it offers one of the fastest conversion speeds available, the conversion time may vary depending on the length of the source video and the time at which it is performed. Because our service is extremely popular, due to overloading our servers during peak hours, the conversion may take a little longer. The speed and stability of the Internet connection can also affect how long the conversion takes. In order to create an idea in your mind, we can say that a five-minute video is converted in about a minute.</p><br>
            <h3 id="question_3">Which formats are supported?</h3>
            <p>&emsp;It supports .mp3 format.</p><br>
            <h3 id="question_6">Can I convert videos using tablets or smartphones?</h3>
            <p>&emsp;It depends on the device. If you are using an Android device, there is no obstacle to converting videos and downloading converted videos directly to your smartphone or tablet. However, if you are using a device with an iOS operating system, you cannot download converted files due to software limitations of the iOS network scanner. At this time, we are in the process of developing a mobile application to solve this problem and facilitate video conversion from mobile devices.</p><br>
